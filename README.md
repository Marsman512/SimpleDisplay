# SimpleDisplay

DEPRICATED!!! Please use QuickDisplay
https://github.com/Marsman512/QuickDisplay

A Java library for LWJGL3 to make it easy again to make a display and take in input.
Documentation will be released soon, but I need to get this functional first.
If you really need to use a library that's still in development, just read the source code.

Feel free to send bug reports
